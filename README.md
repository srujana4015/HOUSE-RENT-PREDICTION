# HOUSE-RENT-PREDICTION
House Price prediction are very stressful work as we have to consider different things while buying a house like the structure and the rooms kitchen parking space and gardens. People donâ€™t know about the factor which influence the house price. But by using the Machine learning we can easily find the house which is to be prefect for us and helps to predict the price accurately.
 Here we used three algorithms Multiple Linear Regression,Decision Tree,Random Forest to know which suits the best according to the dataset chosen.
 The dataset is split into train and test sets. Training data is the subset of original data that is used to train the chosen model, whereas testing data is used to check the accuracy of the model.
 Calculating model score comes out to be
 Multiple Linear Regression Model Score is  63
 Decision tree  Regression Model Score is  7
 Random Forest Regression Model Score is  48
 Multiple Linear Regression performs best for the chosen dataset.
